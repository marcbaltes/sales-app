adding slides to a section: 
	-add an li element to the carousel indicators and make the id "btn(slidenumber)"
	-add a div elemnt to carousel-inner and give it an id of "slide(slidenumber)"
	-change slideCount to the number of slides - 1 (because I had the index start at 0)
	-add the info for the new slide of the info modal in updateInfoModal

outlining when clicked:
	-note: so i used an inset box shadow instead of a border because the border shifts stuff around in the element while the box shadow does not so I just thought it was a cleaner way of doing it
	-just copy the toggleOutline() function and replace the box1 id with whatever element you want to outline
	-also each element that has a clickable outline has its own toggleOutline function which is tedious but it's the easiest way I found to do it

scrolling on pages
	-by default I have the body and html elements not able to be scrolled. to change this just add the class "scroll" to them and you can scroll them again
